This is a collection of the modifications I have written and submitted to the
free, open-source project SimpleMachines' Forum (SMF). You can find my account
on their official forum here,

NOTE: Some of the  modifications listed on this repo may be outdated since some of them
have since been given to other developers to continue updating. You can always
find the latest versions of their version of my mod on the official Customization site.
The ones I haven't given away can always be found at the latest version here or on
my website over at http://anthony-calandra.com.
